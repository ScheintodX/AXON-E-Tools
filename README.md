AXON-E Java Tools
===============================================================================

A Set of tools which make life as a Java coder more easy by making often used methods as simple as they should be.

There are a couple of *shortcut* classes:

E
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
E.cho( Object ... value );
E.rr( Object ... value );
```
is more like `print` or `echo` in scripting languages. It tries to do it's best to output what you give to it, tells you the file and linenumber it is called from and saves keystorkes.


... more examples to come ...
